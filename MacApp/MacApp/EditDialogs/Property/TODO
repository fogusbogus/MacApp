TODO:

- MapKit to be added to the property and street edit forms

There are numerous examples online and it seems quite a small solution to a large problem
Apple maps is the default for this, but we want to embed a small image on the property screen
which can then be clicked to select a new position. It should be ok to have a separate modal
dialog which allows selection/cancellation of a new property location. This should then update the
metadata for saving.

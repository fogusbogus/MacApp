	getSignature() relies on an array of strings and just joins them using a tab character as a separator. This isn't ideal because it doesn't deal with nulls very well, having to decide on a default real value to replace the null.

9-Dec-19	NOTES		General Note
	Instead of using inheritance everywhere it might be a good idea to start to use protocols (interfaces) to provide particular functionality or subscription.

1-Feb-20	TODO002		All applicable files
	The reliance on inheritance is a noble one, but not really a modern concept. Protocols and extensions should be used. See Notes from 9-Dec-19.

6-Mar-20 - Getting stuck for things to do with this. Need to find a new project that I can use for myself and hopefully make some money out of. Especially as my bank has decided they don't have to repay PPI on the mortgage. Bugger.
